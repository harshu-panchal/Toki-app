## 1. Project Overview
**Name**: MatchMint (also referred to as Toki-app)

- **Language**: JavaScript (ES Modules)

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React / Vite
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **State/Logic**: Modular Architecture (likely Context/Hooks based on folder structure)

## 3. Architecture & File Structure

### Backend Structure (`backend/src`)
- `models/`: Database schemas. Key models:
  - `User.js`: Auth, Profile, Wallet Snapshot.
  - `Transaction.js`: Ledger for all coin movements.
  - `Chat.js` / `Message.js`: Messaging data.
  - `Withdrawal.js`: Payout requests.
  - `CoinPlan.js`: Purchase configurations.
- `services/`: Business logic layer (e.g., wallet logic, auth logic).
- `controllers/`: Request handlers (often calling services).
- `socket/`: Real-time event handlers.
- `middleware/`: Auth, Validation, Security.

### Frontend Structure (`frontend/src`)
- `module/`: Feature-sliced architecture.
  - `male/`: Male-specific screens (Dashboard, Wallet, Discovery).
