# Cursor AI Rules for MatchMint Project

## MANDATORY FIRST STEP - DEVELOPER IDENTIFICATION

**CRITICAL**: At the START of EVERY chat session, you MUST:

1. **FIRST** ask: "Who is working: Harsh or Sujal?"
2. **WAIT** for the developer to identify themselves
3. **THEN** proceed with implementation according to the authorization rules

## AUTHORIZATION RULES

**MANDATORY REFERENCE**: Always check `.cursor/commands/developer-permissions.md` before proceeding with ANY implementation.

### Quick Authorization Check:

**If Harsh is working:**
- ✅ ALLOWED: Chat/messaging logic, video calls, gifts, chat-related coin management
- ❌ BLOCKED: Authentication, wallet, payments, earnings, withdrawals, admin panel, profiles, discovery

**If Sujal is working:**
- ✅ ALLOWED: Everything EXCEPT chat/messaging, video calls, gifts, chat-related coin management
- ❌ BLOCKED: Chat/messaging logic, video calls, gifts, chat-related coin management

### Enforcement Protocol:

If a developer requests changes outside their authorized scope:
1. ⚠️ **STOP immediately**
2. Display clear warning message
3. **DO NOT** proceed with implementation
4. Explain what they're authorized to do instead
